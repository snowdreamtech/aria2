################ BitTorrent / PT ################
#If true or mem is specified, when a file whose suffix is .torrent or content type is application/x-bittorrent is downloaded, aria2 parses it as a torrent file and downloads files mentioned in it. If mem is specified, a torrent file is not written to the disk, but is just kept in memory. If false is specified, the .torrent file is downloaded to the disk, but is not parsed as a torrent and its contents are not downloaded. Default: true
follow-torrent=true

listen-port=6881-6999

# Specify the maximum number of peers per torrent. 0 means unlimited. See also bt-request-peer-speed-limit option. Default: 55

# Enable IPv4 DHT functionality. It also enables UDP tracker support. If a private flag is set in a torrent, aria2 doesn't use DHT for that download even if true is given. Default: true
enable-dht=false

# Enable IPv6 DHT functionality. If a private flag is set in a torrent, aria2 doesn't use DHT for that download even if true is given. Use dht-listen-port option to specify port number to listen on. See also dht-listen-addr6 option.
enable-dht6=false

# Set UDP listening port used by DHT(IPv4, IPv6) and UDP tracker. Multiple ports can be specified by using ,, for example: 6881,6885. You can also use - to specify a range: 6881-6999. , and - can be used together. Default: 6881-6999

# Enable Local Peer Discovery. If a private flag is set in a torrent, aria2 doesn't use this feature for that download even if true is given. Default: false

# Enable Peer Exchange extension. If a private flag is set in a torrent, this feature is disabled for that download even if true is given. Default: true
enable-peer-exchange=false

# If the whole download speed of every torrent is lower than SPEED, aria2 temporarily increases the number of peers to try for more download speed. Configuring this option with your preferred download speed can increase your download speed in some cases. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 50K
bt-request-peer-speed-limit=50K

# Specify the prefix of peer ID. The peer ID in BitTorrent is 20 byte length. If more than 20 bytes are specified, only first 20 bytes are used. If less than 20 bytes are specified, random byte data are added to make its length 20 bytes.
# Default: A2-$MAJOR-$MINOR-$PATCH-, $MAJOR, $MINOR and $PATCH are replaced by major, minor and patch version number respectively. For instance, aria2 version 1.18.8 has prefix ID A2-1-18-8-.

# Specify share ratio. Seed completed torrents until share ratio reaches RATIO. You are strongly encouraged to specify equals or more than 1.0 here.

seed-ratio=1.0

# Save download with save-session option even if the download is completed or removed. This option also saves control file in that situations. This may be useful to save BitTorrent seeding which is recognized as completed state. Default: false

# If true is given, after hash check using check-integrity option and file is complete, continue to seed file. If you want to check file and download it only when it is damaged or incomplete, set this option to false. This option has effect only on BitTorrent download. Default: true
bt-hash-check-seed=true

# Seed previously downloaded files without verifying piece hashes. Default: false
bt-seed-unverified=true

# Save metadata as ".torrent" file. This option has effect only when BitTorrent Magnet URI is used. The file name is hex encoded info hash with suffix ".torrent". The directory to be saved is the same directory where download file is saved. If the same file already exists, metadata is not saved. See also bt-metadata-only option. Default: false
